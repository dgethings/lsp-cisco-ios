# Agent Team Configuration Template

[[LLM: This template is for creating agent team configurations in YAML format. Follow the structure carefully and replace all placeholders with appropriate values. The team name should reflect the team's purpose and domain focus.]]

```yaml
bundle:
  name: {{team-display-name}}
  [[LLM: Use format "Team [Descriptor]" for generic teams or "[Domain] Team" for specialized teams. Examples: "Team Fullstack", "Healthcare Team", "Legal Team"]]

  icon: {{team-emoji}}
  [[LLM: Choose a single emoji that best represents the team's function or name]]

  description: {{team-description}}
  [[LLM: Write a concise description (1 sentence) that explains:
  1. The team's primary purpose
  2. What types of projects they handle
  3. Any special capabilities or focus areas
  4. Keep it short as its displayed in menus
  Example: "Full Stack Ideation Web App Team." or "Startup Business Coaching team"]]

agents:
  [[LLM: List the agents that make up this team. Guidelines:
  - Use shortened agent names (e.g., 'analyst' not 'business-analyst')
  - Include 'bmad-orchestrator' for bmad-core teams as the coordinator
  - Only use '*' for an all-inclusive team (rare)
  - Order agents logically by workflow (analysis → design → development → testing)
  - For expansion packs, include both core agents and custom agents]]
